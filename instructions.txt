Change config.php as per your database

Change urls in line number 77 and 114 of custom.js to point to your location of payouts.php and user_details.php

I know for a fact that the payout chart is remaining, would the payout table (user_transactions table) have so many entries so as to show graph for payouts of this hour/this day, etc?

THe justgage component is made to auto refresh every 2 seconds, let me know if that is taking too much load, I would remove it.

Request you to release half the payment if you'd be okay with the work.
